## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the Random Quote Generator up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using your preferred method (SSH, HTTPS, or GitHub CLI):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-quote-generator.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd random-quote-generator
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server and view the application in your browser, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open a new browser window with the Random Quote Generator. You can now interact with the application and generate random quotes.

To stop the development server, simply press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal.

## Customization

If you want to customize the quotes displayed in the generator, you can easily do so by modifying the `quotes.json` file in the `src` folder. Add, remove, or modify quotes as you like. The application will automatically use the updated quotes.

Here is the structure of the `quotes.json` file:

```json
[
  {
    "quote": "Your quote here.",
    "author": "Author Name"
  },
  {
    "quote": "Another quote.",
    "author": "Another Author"
  },
  // Add more quotes as needed
]
```
